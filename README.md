Campus Connect is a unified mentorship platform designed exclusively for USF students. It bridges the gap between batches by making mentorship accessible, less awkward, and more effective.

Juniors often feel intimidated to approach seniors for guidance. Campus Connect solves this by providing a dedicated space where everyone is a mentor to someone below their year.

✨ Key Features

🕵️‍♂️ Smart Role Detection: The system automatically identifies relationships. A 3rd-year student is a "Senior" to a freshman but a "Junior" to a final-year student. No static roles.

🔍 Skill-Based Discovery: Find the right mentor. Filter seniors by specific skills like React, AI, Internships, or Research.

💬 Real-Time Messaging: Instant chat functionality to ask doubts and share resources without leaving the platform.

🔐 Secure Authentication: Student-focused login system to ensure a safe community.

📱 Responsive Design: Fully optimized for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop.
